👋 Hi, I’m David.

💼 I’m a Data Scientist with a background in social sciences, interested in machine learning/deep learning, natural language processing, and causal inference. My GitHub showcases a few current projects applying and playing around with these interests. For example,
1. in [AgePrediction](https://github.com/davidhilpert/AgePrediction), I finetune a BERT-model to predict birth year from first names (pretraining with finetuning)
1. in [NietzscheNext](https://github.com/davidhilpert/NietzscheNext), I use Transformers to build a model for text autocompletion based on Nietzsche's collected works
1. in [RAG_Demo](https://github.com/davidhilpert/RAG_Demo), I employ Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in order to build a chatbot that can answer questions about EU legal texts

📈 In my published work, my co-authors and I focus on causal inference in survey experiments—particularly using vignette designs and conjoint experiments—to investigate public preferences in the electoral market. You can find a list on my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=RkCa68wAAAAJ&hl=de).
